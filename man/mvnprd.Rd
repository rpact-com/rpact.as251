\usage{
mvnprd(..., A, B, BPD, EPS = 1e-06, INF, IERC = 1, HINC = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{Upper limits of integration. Array of N dimensions}

\item{B}{Lower limits of integration. Array of N dimensions}

\item{BPD}{Values defining correlation structure. Array of N dimensions}

\item{EPS}{desired accuracy.  Defaults to 1e-06}

\item{INF}{Determines where integration is done to infinity. Array of N dimensions.
Valid values for INF(I):
  0 = c(B(I), Inf),
  1 = c(-Inf, A(I)),
  2 = c(B(I), A(I))}

\item{IERC}{error control. If set to 1, strict error control based on
fourth derivative is used.  If set to zero, error control based on halving intervals is used}

\item{HINC}{Interval width for Simpson's rule. Value of zero caused a default .24 to be used}
}
\description{
For a multivariate normal vector with correlation structure
defined by RHO(I,J) = BPD(I) * BPD(J), computes the probability
that the vector falls in a rectangle in n-space with error
less than eps.
